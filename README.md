# Version 1.8.0 (Major Update)

- **Removed Template Feature**: Legacy template system is removed. Now you can update configurations simply by re-inserting into an existing index/outline.
- **UI Overhaul**: Integrated "Notebook Index" and "Sub-page Index + Outline" into the main Index settings. Redesigned the settings panel with horizontal tabs (Index, Outline, Builder).
- **Icon System Optimization**: 
    - Added optional icons for Index and Outline (disabled by default).
    - For Outlines: Rich text sync is supported when icons are enabled; plain text sync is used when disabled to ensure link stability.
- **Emoji Picker**: Alt + Click on SiYuan's built-in emojis to pick and replace them.
- **Builder Improvements**: Removed the "Pull" functionality for a leaner experience.
- **Icon Support Optimization**: Non-built-in icons are now displayed as standard SiYuan icons to prevent mojibake.
